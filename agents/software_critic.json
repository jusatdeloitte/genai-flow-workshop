This can be inefficient for large input sizes.\n    - The variable names `elem` and `elem2` are not very descriptive.\n    - The function lacks comments, making it harder to understand the logic at a glance.\n\n3. **Suggestions**:\n    - Sort the list first, then check adjacent elements to reduce the time complexity to O(n log n).\n    - Use more descriptive variable names, such as `num1` and `num2`.\n    - Add comments to improve code readability.\n\nNow, let's test this code by running him, so we can proceed with further improvements!",
